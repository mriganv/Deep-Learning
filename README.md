# Deep-Learning

## Overview:

The purpose of this project analysis is to use the Tensorflow deep learning framework, written in Python to predict the success of applicants funded by Alphabet soup foundation. 

## Results:

### Data Preprocessing

The column IS_SUCCESSFUL will be the target variable as it has the binary data referring to whether the money was used effectively. 
APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, ASK_AMT columns are the features for the model.
Encoding of the categorical variables, spliting into training and testing datasets and standardization have been applied to the features.
Itâ€™s best to drop most of the non-numeric features like EIN and NAME columns from the dataframe. As these variables are neither targets nor features.

### Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
Selected Relu activation for hidden layers and Sigmoid for the output layer. And selected 2 hidden layers with 77 and 50 neurons in each layer respectively. This gave us 7,151 total trainable parameters for the model.

#### Result:
Got an accuracy of 72.5%. ![Screenshot 2021-11-10 215822](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81407869/141245904-5ba8dde9-ce23-4207-a57c-bf0b0623b7ac.jpg)

 * How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
    * Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
    * What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
