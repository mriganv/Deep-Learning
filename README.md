# Deep-Learning

## Overview:

The purpose of this project analysis is to use the Tensorflow deep learning framework, written in Python to predict the success of applicants funded by Alphabet soup foundation. 

## Results:

### Data Preprocessing

The column IS_SUCCESSFUL will be the target variable as it has the binary data referring to whether the money was used effectively. 
The following columns APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, ASK_AMT are the features for our model.
Encoding of the categorical variables, spliting into training and testing datasets and standardization have been applied to the features.
Itâ€™s best to drop most of the non-numeric features like EIN and NAME columns from the dataframe. As these variables are neither targets nor features.
